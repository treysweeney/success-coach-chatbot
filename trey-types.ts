/**
 * Tool definitions in Vercel AI SDK form.
 *
 * The AI SDK's `Tool` is the provider-neutral shape: `inputSchema` accepts
 * either a Zod schema or a JSON Schema, and any provider adapter knows how to
 * render it. Defining tools this way means this module imports nothing from
 * `@anthropic-ai/sdk` — the Anthropic-specific wire format is produced in
 * `chat/client.ts`, at the provider boundary where it belongs.
 *
 * Two differences from Anthropic's tool type shape the code below:
 *
 * 1. **AI SDK tools carry no name.** A name is the key a tool is registered
 *    under in a `ToolSet` record. Since this codebase passes tools around as an
 *    array, `ExecutableTool` carries the name alongside the definition, and
 *    `toolSet()` builds the record when one is needed.
 * 2. **`inputSchema` is a `FlexibleSchema`, not raw JSON.** Reading the JSON
 *    Schema back out goes through `asSchema`, and is asynchronous, because a
 *    schema is allowed to resolve lazily.
